2. The first call was 60mins and the last two were 30mins.
3. Most questions were operational and management/strategy type questions. Lots of how and why regarding red team operations and how to work with other teams and why/how do I do things.

### General Thoughts
**The interviews were way too fast**\
The first was about 1 hr which seemed about right. It was comfortable enough to no feel rushed but we also we were free to end a few minutes early and I got time at the end for questions. The last two interviews we each 30 mintes, but there were two interviewers in each, so that each interviewer had to share the 30 minutes. This meant the first 5 mins were wasted with casual formalities of tardiness, hi how are you chat and intros, and general banter to set the mood. This is genearlly expected and helpful, but not when you only have 30mins to sell yourself on your life's previous X-years of work. The shorter interviews turned into the two interviewers attempting to bounce their shared time back and forth between each other, which meant each one got to ask about 3 questions, and I had a very limited time and opportunitity to clarify the questions and respond with sufficient depth. Takeaway here is that 30 mins is not long enough to conduct a semi-senior interview.

**Determine the interviewee's upper boundaries**\
The last interview's interviewers asked questions that were more "alongside" red teaming, rather than core red teaming, so they were a bit more challenging. I had not really considered the topics before being asked them, so I was caught off guard and had to deeply consider my responses and start answering within about 5-10 seconds. Key takeaway here is that it helps to flush the mind-memory between questions and start totally fresh with each new question.
