# Thinking Like A Red Teamer
Studies on Red Teaming concepts. To truly succeed in Red Teaming, one must become fully submersed.

## Cyber Hacking _by Scientific American_
- book is separated into articals on various hacking topics
- [1] hardware hacking: touches on seriousness (but difficulties) of hardware attacks. Mentions difficulties of securing supply chain stacks given so many uncontrolled touch points in production/asssembly. Goes over hardware block corruption and protections. 
- [2] stuxnet review: usb worm given to worker, payload searched internally for months before targeting physical components to speed up rotaries (yet report healthy functions) until they were destroyed. Talks about difficulties in patching SCADA systems. 
- [3] code red worm: DDoS worm targeting vulnerable IIS servers
- [4] hacker wars: an argument on a hacker forum turns into a trolling/vengefull operation between the two participants. Detailed story on attacks and defense going back and forth several times. One TTP takeaway is to not get too excited when we win or get fame. Stay low and slow and don't be messy. 

## Cult of the Dead Cow _by Joseph Menn_
**July 2022**
- goes over activist history and involvement in world governments and culture. Their motivations, their leadership, their ethical and theological mindsets and reasonings. 
- Politically left book on hacker activist group history and motivations - not very many TTPs or valuable learning. 
- repeating TTPs across targets can identify you
- latter portion of book ties in original CDC members' histories to current lives, like Mudge being head of security at Twitter and another having issues with sexual molestation. 
- the ending ties in liberal politician Beto O'Rourke's brief, early background in the Cult of the Dead Cow (CDC) and sounds like a liberal pitch as it praises his liberal views and efforts while it bashes republicans, but I do think the author is trying to be politically neutral. I think they're just trying to outline his background and a brief history of a prominent politician's connection to the CDC, while focusing on the benefits that hacktivist groups can have on society. 
- overall, not many good TTPs but is a good book on hacktivist history and motivations and theories and ethics and involvement in world affairs

## The Art of War _by Sun Tzu_
**July 2022**
- do the unexpected. Attack on holidays, generate noise when not acting, come from inside.
- attack when defense is distracted (day after an 0day, company wide meetings, drunken holidays)
- resources are expensive. Utilize the target's (infra, recon, vuln mgmt, dns records...)
- seek battle only after you've won. We control success by controlling the battle. Know when and how to attack. Prepare, be intentional. Put yourself beyond the possibility of defeat. To ensure victory, win with ease. Win by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes established the certainty of victory. It means conquering an enemy that is already defeated. A skilled fighter puts himself into a position that makes defeat impossible and doesn't miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
- red teamers are prompt in their decisions and the energy is like the bending of a crossbow and decision as the releasing of the trigger. 
- you can ensure victory by only attacking places that are in defended (default creds, publicly accessible, data leakage)
- "avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak"

## Red Teaming _by Bryce Hoffman_
**June 2022**
- if 10 people have the same info and 9 of them take the same stance, it's the duty of the 10th person to disagree. #israelimilitary
- fight groupthink
- be ready for discomfort, you're constantly going against the norm and will face pushback until you prove your case
- you are the devil's advocate, the hostile witness #romancatholic
- to identify the initiative to be taken, ask why 5 times. Example: Red Team was able to steal 20k customer files. Why? Because they found AWS keys on a website. Why? Because a developer posted a question with the keys. Why? Because they don't understand the technology or security best practices. Etc...
- "The Red Team's job is to take a believe or assertion that is central to an organization's strategy and make the most compelling case possible that the opposite is true"
- we don't prove how a point is right or find the right answer, rather show how the current prospect or solution is a disaster
- find gaps in existing analysis, uncover import information that was overlooked or missed
- know when to stop. Like when you reach your objective, or proved sufficient impact to inspire change, or reach the emulated adversary's skill peak - unless they're an initial access broker ;)

## Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground _by Kevin Poulsen_
**May 2022**
- I never wrote notes for this book. It's an entertaining book about a guy's life story of how he got into mischief and stealing and how it led into a life of hacking. It's a good primer on how the underground marketplace works, which is why I chose it. He eventually starts running major underground businesses with credit card theft/sales. His hacking work and avoiding arrest and his relationships - a mixture of various aspects of his life and his story. Provides a good perspective on the past criminal underground, though I'm not sure how closely it resembles the current underground marketplace.

## Red Team: How to Succeed By Thinking Like the Enemy _by Micah Zenko_
**February 2022**
- I never wrote notes for this book. It's basically about the history of red teaming (catholic church) and a few different industries that use red teaming (military, gov, businesses, cyber). It's pretty good but it goes a lot into gov and army.

## The Art of Deception, The Art of Invisibility, Ghost in the Wires (3 different books) _by Kevin Mitnick_
**August 2021**
- I never wrote notes for these books. I don't remember the differences between these books but I read two of them i think. Ghost in the Wires talks about Kevin's life of phone Phreaking in the early hacker days and his dodging FBI and stealing identities. One of the books talks about the various ways to use TOR to remain anonymous and a few things like that - I think it was Art of Invisibility. 
- If I recall correctly, these books weren't really technical enough - they were more for interested non-IT folk or concerned citizens or interested journalists. They were somewhat entertaining but I think I stopped one half way through cause I wasn't learning anything.
