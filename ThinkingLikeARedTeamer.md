# Thinking Like A Red Teamer
How to think like a Red Teamer

## Red Teaming, by Bryce Hoffman
- if 10 people have the same info and 9 of them take the same stance, it's the duty of the 10th person to disagree. #israelimilitary
- fight groupthink
- be ready for discomfort, you're constantly going against the norm and will face pushback until you prove your case
- you are the devil's advocate, the hostile witness #romancatholic
- to identify the initiative to be taken, ask why 5 times. Example: Red Team was able to steal 20k customer files. Why? Because they found AWS keys on a website. Why? Because a developer posted a question with the keys. Why? Because they don't understand the technology or security best practices. Etc...
- "The Red Team's job is to take a believe or assertion that is central to an organization's strategy and make the most compelling case possible that the opposite is true"
- we don't prove how a point is right or find the right answer, rather show how the current prospect or solution is a disaster
- find gaps in existing analysis, uncover import information that was overlooked or missed
- know when to stop. Like when you reach your objective, or proved sufficient impact to inspire change, or reach the emulated adversary's skill peak - unless they're an initial access broker ;)

## The Art of War, by Sun Tzu
- do the unexpected. Attack on holidays, generate noise when not acting, come from inside. 
- resources are expensive. Utilize the target's (infra, recon, vuln mgmt, dns records...)
