# Thinking Like A Red Teamer
How to think like a Red Teamer

## Red Teaming, by Bryce Hoffman
- if 10 people have the same info and 9 of them take the same stance, it's the duty of the 10th person to disagree. #israelimilitary
- fight groupthink
- be ready for discomfort, you're constantly going against the norm and will face pushback until you prove your case
- you are the devil's advocate, the hostile witness #romancatholic
- to identify the initiative to be taken, ask why 5 times. Example: Red Team was able to steal 20k customer files. Why? Because they found AWS keys on a website. Why? Because a developer posted a question with the keys. Why? Because they don't understand the technology or security best practices. Etc...
- "The Red Team's job is to take a believe or assertion that is central to an organization's strategy and make the most compelling case possible that the opposite is true"
- we don't prove how a point is right or find the right answer, rather show how the current prospect or solution is a disaster
- find gaps in existing analysis, uncover import information that was overlooked or missed
- know when to stop. Like when you reach your objective, or proved sufficient impact to inspire change, or reach the emulated adversary's skill peak - unless they're an initial access broker ;)

## The Art of War, by Sun Tzu
- do the unexpected. Attack on holidays, generate noise when not acting, come from inside. 
- resources are expensive. Utilize the target's (infra, recon, vuln mgmt, dns records...)
- seek battle only after you've won. We control success by controlling the battle. Know when and how to attack. Prepare, be intentional. Put yourself beyond the possibility of defeat. To ensure victory, win with ease. Win by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes established the certainty of victory. It means conquering an enemy that is already defeated. A skilled fighter puts himself into a position that makes defeat impossible and doesn't miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
- red teamers are prompt in their decisions and the energy is like the bending of a crossbow and decision as the releasing of the trigger. 
- you can ensure victory by only attacking places that are in defended (default creds, publicly accessible, data leakage)
