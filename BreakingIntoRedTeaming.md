# Breaking Into Red Teaming

## Preface
This is my story of how I got into red teaming, from college, undergrad jobs, professional jobs, then finally the red team!

## College & Prep
I obtained a bachelor + master in a technical/business field and worked various jobs throughout college that helped me gain experience in code development, systems integration, customer experience and security review. This split-focused degree was valuable to me because it helped me develop technical skills that I can hack with, but also business skills that I can use in a professional environment. Working during school was critical to me developing hands-on and real-world experience and teamwork and how to work in a company-environment.

### Technical skills
This is a no-brainer. If you want to hack, then you need to learn how things work and how to use the tools. Starting off your schooling and career in a field like systems administration of software engineering can give you a strong foundation of technical understanding that will enable faster and deeper understanding of security concepts and systems environments down the road. Basic coding skills are very important as red teamers need to utilyze public exploits and tools and also build their own. Sys admin type knowledge is also handy when it comes to advanced exploitation and post exploitation (persistence, privilege escalation, lateral). Try to surround yourself with classes and jobs and friends that can help you develop the necessary security skills.

### Business skills
In every professional role, there is always a customer - whether it's a paying person/company or your own company itself. You provide a service, so you've also got to provide a friendly and valuable experience to your customer.

## Early Career
Red teams are hard to get into right out of college. That's probably because of the high risk of error and the prerequisite knowledge required to be succesful. 

## Red Team Value
**How is value derived from a red team? Why are they paying me to hack?**\
A red team's impact is specifically measured based on inspired initiatives that result from red teaming activities.
