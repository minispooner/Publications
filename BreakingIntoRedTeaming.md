# Breaking Into Red Teaming

## Preface
This is my story of how I got into red teaming, from college, undergrad jobs, professional jobs, then finally the red team!

## College & Prep
I obtained a bachelor + master in a technical/business field and worked various jobs throughout college that helped me gain experience in code development, systems integration, customer experience and security review. This split-focused degree was valuable to me because it helped me develop technical skills that I can hack with, but also business skills that I can use in a professional environment. Working during school was critical to me developing hands-on and real-world experience and teamwork and how to work in a company-environment.

### Technical skills
This is a no-brainer. If you want to hack, then you need to learn how things work and how to use the tools. Starting off your schooling and career in a field like systems administration or software engineering can give you a strong foundation of basic technical knowledge that will enable faster and deeper understanding of security concepts and systems and environments down the road. Basic coding skills are very important as red teamers need to utilyze public exploits and tools and also build their own. Sys admin type knowledge is also handy when it comes to advanced exploitation and post exploitation (persistence, privilege escalation, lateral). Try to surround yourself with classes and jobs and friends that can help you develop the necessary security skills, and try to find a mentor who you can bounce questions and advice off of.

### Business skills
In every professional role, there is always a customer - whether it's a paying person or company, or your own company itself. In red teaming, your're not coding a product, rather your're providing a service. Part of your services will of course include hacking, but it's for specific reasons and objectives. Typically at the end of each engagement or campaign, there is a report or readout to upper management. This is a critical part of being a red teamer - the ability to sway an audience. The goal of red teaming is to inspire systemic security improvements for your customer - NOT file tickets, though you probably will. So you'll need strong presentation or report-writing skills, dependong how your company consumes reports or how you deliver. A basic understanding of how businesses operate will also help you better understand your customer and their needs. You could also think of your own red team as a business within your business - if you're an in-house red team. Key takeaway here: Red teamers hack with a purpose, and understanding how your work can (and must) impact a company is important. 

## Early Career
Red teams are hard to get into right out of college. That's probably because of the high risk of error and the prerequisite knowledge required to be succesful. 

## Red Team Value

A red team's impact is specifically measured based on inspired initiatives that result from red teaming activities.
