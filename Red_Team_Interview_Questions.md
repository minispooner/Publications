# Red Team Interview Questions
This is a list of interview questions that I've gotten as I interview at major tech companies in the US for Red Team positions.

## Tips
- Always follow STAR answer formats. Situation, Task, Action, Results. [Amazon STAR link](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/in-person-interview).
- Phone interviews (typically 2) are tech-heavy to make sure you have the base requirements for the job and level.
- On-site interviews (typically 5) are more business-oriented in how you'll fit in with the company and meld with the team. They'll ask about your EQ and how you've delt with situations in the past.

## Questions

- Explain to an executive what Red Teaming is.
